import SwiftGodot

/// Scans overlapping `Node2D` bodies, filters by groups, and emits a target when the best candidate changes.
///
/// `TargetScanner2D` is an `Area2D` that maintains a weak list of bodies
/// currently inside its collision shape(s). Each frame it prunes dead references,
/// selects a target (optionally the nearest to the owner), and publishes a
/// `TargetAcquired` event only when the chosen target differs from the previous
/// emission.
///
/// ### Filtering
/// If `targetGroups` is non-empty, only bodies that belong to at least one of
/// those groups are tracked. Use Godot groups to tag ally/enemy/friendly units.
///
/// ### Target selection
/// - When `pickNearest == true`, chooses the closest candidate to `owner2D`.
/// - Otherwise, returns the first live candidate (insertion order).
///
/// ### Usage
/// ```swift
/// @Godot
/// final class Turret: Node2D {
///   @Child("Scanner") var scanner: TargetScanner2D?
///   @Service<TargetAcquired> var bus: EventBus<TargetAcquired>?
///
///   override func _ready() {
///     // Configure groups the turret is interested in:
///     scanner?.targetGroups = ["Enemies"]
///     // Elsewhere: listen on the bus to rotate/aim at the target.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Important: This node calls `bindProps()` in `_ready()` to activate
///   property-wrapper bindings (`@Service`, `@Ancestor`, etc.).
/// - Note: Ensure a suitable `CollisionShape2D` is present so overlaps occur.
