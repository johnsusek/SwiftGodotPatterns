/// A timer-driven generator of objects at a target rate.
///
/// `SpawnSystem` counts down in `tick(delta:)` and, when its internal clock
/// reaches zero, it creates or acquires one object, fires hooks in a
/// well-defined order, and schedules the next spawn using `rate` and `jitter`.
///
/// You can supply objects from:
/// - a pool via `usePool(_:)`, or
/// - a factory closure via `make`.
/// If both are set, the pool is tried first and the factory is a fallback.
///
/// ### Scheduling
/// - `rate` is in **spawns per second** (e.g. `2.0` -> every 0.5s).
/// - `jitter` adds a uniform random offset in seconds in the range
///   `[-jitter, +jitter]` to the base interval. The final interval is clamped
///   to be non-negative.
/// - `reset(scheduleImmediately:)` sets when the next spawn will occur:
///   - `true` -> on the very next `tick` call,
///   - `false` -> after one full (possibly jittered) interval.
/// - Large `delta` values produce **at most one** spawn per `tick` call; missed
///   intervals do not "catch up" with multiple spawns.
///
/// ### Example
/// ```swift
/// let spawner = SpawnSystem<Bullet>()
/// spawner.rate = 5           // 5 bullets/sec
/// spawner.jitter = 0.05      // small timing variance
/// spawner.make = { Bullet() } // or spawner.usePool(pool.acquire)
///
/// spawner.onSpawn = { b in
///   b.configureAndAttach()
/// }
///
/// spawner.reset() // spawn on next tick
///
/// // Game loop:
/// func _process(delta: Double) {
///   spawner.tick(delta: delta)
/// }
/// ```
