/// A helper that automatically despawns its host node (the parent)
/// under common conditions:
///
/// - **Time-based expiry** via ``seconds``
/// - **Off-screen expiry** via ``offscreen`` with optional debounce ``offscreenDelay``
/// - **Pool-aware**: optionally returns the host to a pool using ``releaseToPool``
///
/// Add `AutoDespawn2D` as a **child** of the node you want to despawn. On first
/// ready, it captures `getParent()` as its *host* and manages teardown when any
/// configured condition is met. Teardown is **idempotent** (it runs once).
///
/// ### Usage
/// ```swift
/// // Free after 4 seconds or when it leaves the camera (whichever first).
/// GNode<Node2D>("Bullet") {
///   Sprite2D$().res(\.texture, "art/bullet.png")
///   GNode<AutoDespawn2D>().configure {
///     $0.seconds = 4
///     $0.offscreen = true
///   }
/// }
/// ```
