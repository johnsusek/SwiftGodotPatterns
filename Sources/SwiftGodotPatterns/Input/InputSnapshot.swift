/// - ``down``: whether the control is currently held
/// - ``pressed``: became held **this frame** (rising edge)
/// - ``released``: became unheld **this frame** (falling edge)
///
/// Call ``update(isDown:)`` once per frame with the current physical/virtual
/// state to advance edges. Edges are computed by comparing the new state to the

  ///
  /// - Parameter isDown: The instantaneous state for this frame.

  /// - ``pressed`` becomes `true` iff `isDown` is `true` and ``down`` was `false`.
  /// - ``released`` becomes `true` iff `isDown` is `false` and ``down`` was `true`.

///
/// `InputSnapshot` polls a set of Godot action names each frame using
/// `Input.isActionPressed`, storing a ``PressState`` per action (keyed by
/// `StringName`). Read convenience accessors like ``down(_:)``/``pressed(_:)``/``released(_:)``
/// after calling ``poll(_:)``.
///
/// ### Usage
/// ```swift
/// final class Player: CharacterBody2D {
///   private var input = InputSnapshot()
///   private let actions = ["move_left", "move_right", "jump", "attack"]
///
///   override func _physicsProcess(delta: Double) {
///     input.poll(actions)
///
///     if input.wasPressed("jump") { /* start jump */ }
///     if input.isDown("move_left") { /* apply left movement */ }
///     if input.wasReleased("attack") { /* finish attack charge */ }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Only actions passed to ``poll(_:)`` are updated on a given frame.
///   Omitting an action leaves its previously stored state unchanged.
public struct InputSnapshot {
  /// Backing store of action states keyed by action `StringName`.
  public var map: [StringName: PressState] = [:]

  /// Creates an empty snapshot.
  public init() {}

  /// Polls the given action names and updates their states for this frame.
  ///
  /// - Parameter actions: Godot input action names (as configured in the project).
  ///
  /// For each `name`, this calls `Input.isActionPressed(action:)` and updates the
  /// per-action ``PressState``. Actions not listed are left untouched this frame.

    for name in actions {
      let key = StringName(name)
      var state = map[key] ?? PressState()
